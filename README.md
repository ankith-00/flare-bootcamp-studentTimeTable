## 📌 Overview

This project is a decentralized **School Timetable Manager** deployed on the **Flare Network (Coston2 Testnet)**.  
It allows users to read and update the subject assigned to each day of the week (Monday–Sunday) using blockchain technology, ensuring transparency, security, and immutable records.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Read timetable from the blockchain
- ✏️ Update timetable using wallet transactions
- 🔒 Wallet-gated interactions (via wagmi)
- ⛽ Real blockchain transaction flow
- 🔄 Auto-refresh on confirmed transactions
- 📡 Works on Flare Coston2 testnet

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Schools traditionally store schedules in centralized systems that can be:

- Modified without tracking
- Lost due to system failure
- Lacking transparency

By decentralizing, this app ensures:

- Transparent change history
- Permanent and tamper-resistant data
- On-chain verifiable updates

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This project demonstrates how even simple everyday systems—like class scheduling—can benefit from blockchain features such as:

| Benefit               | How This App Uses It                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Decentralization      | No central server controls schedule data           |
| Immutability          | All updates are recorded via verified transactions |
| Ownership             | Only wallet-holders can change the schedule        |
| Trustless Interaction | No login required — wallet = identity              |

---

## ⚡ Use Cases

- School administration systems
- Student timetable apps
- Blockchain education demos
- DAO-controlled school schedules
